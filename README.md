This Wolfram Mathematica notebook serves as a supplement to Y. Guo, et al, arXiv : 2502.16567, which is submitted to ApJ.

It is used to solve the eigenequations Eqs. 26 and 27, along with connecting conditions Eqs. 28 and 29 in the paper, for the case of uniform shear flows with v_0 = V_0 sgn(x), under a uniform external magnetic field. 
Follow the annotations in the .nb file, and one can reproduce the majority of Fig. 3 in the paper. Figs. 1 and 2 can be reproduced similarly with the functions defined in the notebook.

See Appendix A in the paper above for detailed mathematical considerations.

Run on Wolfram Mathematica 14.0.
